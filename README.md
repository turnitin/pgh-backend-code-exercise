# README: Turnitin Pittsburgh Backend Exercise

Welcome! We're excited you've decided to talk with us about a position on our
engineering team.

The purpose of this exercise is so we can have a conversation about your
technical background and abilities. We think that asking you to code on a
whiteboard during an interview isn't a great way to have a conversation. And
even if we sit down and pair during an interview it's a higher pressure
situation than it could be.

Instead we ask that you read these instructions and do an hour or two of work,
on your time, to complete the exercise. During the interview we'll talk about
decisions you've made, the resulting application, and how you might change it
given different circumstances.

Below are two sections:

* Instructions: the problem we'd like you to solve along with expectations we
  have about your solution.
* Logistics: constraints around the problem, and how we'd like you to
  communicate your solution to us

# Instructions

There is a problem. You need to solve it.

# Logistics

__1.__ You should take a max of two hours to complete this exercise. We want to
be both respectful of your time and fair to other candidates who might not have
a whole weekend to work on it.

__2.__ You will need to use git for this exercise. To get these instructions
and a repo with test scripts do the following:

A: (Create a bitbucket account)[https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/] if you
don't already have one. For the examples below we assume a user `pusheen`.

B: Clone our repository:

```
# Using ssh
$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:lightsidelabs/backend-code-exercise.git

# Using https
$ git clone https://pusheen@bitbucket.org/lightsidelabs/backend-code-exercise.git
```

__3.__ Once you are done you can put your solution in your own repository by
adding it as a remote and pushing to it.

A: Create a new repo via the bitbucket UI, let's assume you call it
`backend-coding-exercise` to mirror ours.

B: Please make the repository *private*, we'd like to make sure that every
candidate's work is his or her own.

C: Add your repo as a remote and push:

```
$ git remote add myrepo ssh://git@bitbucket.org:pusheen/backend-code-exercise.git
$ git push myrepo master
```

__4.__ Give Bitbucket user `cwinters` access to your repository.

__5.__ At least a day before your in-person interview, email
`cwinters@turnitin.com` your repo address.
